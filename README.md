# 8-bit breadboard computer parts list
This is a complete overview of all the parts required for Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)

I have finished my build, but will keep the parts list updated with the parts mentioned in Ben Eater's videos.  
Here is a quick demo of my build running a Fibonacci program:

**Important notes:** 
- The video series is still on-going, but I think there will be no more new parts. If new parts are added I will update this list.
- I only included the parts for the final modules, not parts that are used in the experimentation phases.
- The EEPROM programmer (as stand alone product) is optional, you can also build it yourself. Components for this are marked under the EEPROM Programmer module.

The parts list is now only available from the Excel sheet and PDF file:

Several resources have been added to help you during the build:
