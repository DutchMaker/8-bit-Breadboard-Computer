# 8-bit breadboard computer parts list
If you are following Ben Eater's build of an 8-bit breadboard computer (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) and are looking for a complete (*) list of all the parts, then here you go:

**) The video series is still on-going so the part list is not complete yet. I will update this list every time a new video has been upload.*
