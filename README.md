# 8-bit breadboard computer parts list
This is a complete overview of all the parts required for Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)

**Important notes:** 
- The video series is still on-going so **the parts list is not complete yet!** I will update this list every time a new video has been upload.
- I only included the parts for the final modules, not parts that are used in the experimentation phases.
- The EEPROM programmer (as stand alone product) is optional, you can also build it yourself. Components for this are marked under the EEPROM Programmer module.

The parts list is now only available from the Excel sheet and PDF file:

- https://github.com/DutchMaker/8-bit-Breadboard-Computer/raw/master/parts.pdf 

Several resources have been added to help you during the build:
